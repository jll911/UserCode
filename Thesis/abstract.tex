%% \noindent Inclusive dijet and trijet production in deep inelastic $ep$ scattering has been
%% measured for $10<Q^2<100$ GeV$^2$ and low Bjorken $x$,
%% $10^{-4}<x_{\rm Bj}<10^{-2}$.  The data were taken at the HERA $ep$ collider
%% with center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 318$ GeV using the ZEUS detector
%% and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $82~{\rm pb}^{-1}$.  Jets were
%% identified in the hadronic center-of-mass (HCM) frame using the $k_{T}$ cluster
%% algorithm in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode.  Measurements of dijet and
%% trijet
%% differential cross sections are presented as functions of $Q^2$, $x_{\rm Bj}$, jet
%% transverse energy, and jet pseudorapidity.  As a further examination of low-$x_{\rm Bj}$ dynamics,
%% multi-differential cross sections as functions of the jet correlations in transverse
%% momenta,
%% azimuthal angles, and pseudorapidity are also presented.  Calculations at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^3)$ generally
%% describe the trijet data well and improve the description of the dijet data compared
%% to the
%% calculation at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$.

\noindent The cross section of 
$p p \rightarrow Z \rightarrow e^+ e^-$ 
was measured for $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV $pp$ collisions 
at the Large Hadron Collider using the 
Compact Muon Solenoid detector.  
Well-reconstructed electrons within the region 
$ |\eta| < 1.4442, 1.566 < |\eta| < 2.5$ 
and with a transverse energy of at least 25 GeV 
were used, 
with an invariant mass window of 60 to 120 GeV.  
In 36.1 \pb of data, 8453 candidate events were found.  
The cross section was measured to be 
990 $\pm$ 48 pb, 
which agrees well with the NNLO prediction 
of 972 pb.
