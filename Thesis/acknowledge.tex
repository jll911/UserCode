%ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS HERE

I would like to thank the professors 
who have mentored and advised me 
during my time as a grad student, 
Wesley Smith and Sridhara Dasu, 
as well as the scientists I have worked with 
over the years: 
Pam Klabbers, Sascha Savin, and Monika Grothe.  
I would also like to thank my fellow CMS students 
for their camaraderie and willingness to share knowledge, 
and my friends in Madison and in Geneva 
for providing a social outlet and a listening ear.  

Finally, I would like to thank my family, 
who never stopped encouraging me 
throughout this journey.
