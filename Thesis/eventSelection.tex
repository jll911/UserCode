\chapter{Event Selection}
\label{evSel}
Most analyses, including this one, are only interested in particle 
interactions that happen relatively rarely during proton collisions.  
Therefore, methods have been developed to sort through all the 
events and select the interesting ones for further study.  
This selection takes place both ``online'', in real time as the 
detector is running, and ``offline'', after the previously-selected data has 
been stored.  
%The selection done online is primarily for the purpose of reducing 
%the volume of data enough to store it
The online selection serves primarily for reducing the 
volume of data enough to feasibly store it, and so it is done centrally. 
In addition, the online selection is fairly general, 
while the offline selection is much more detailed and specific to individual 
analyses, and hence it is mostly done by the user of the data.  


\section{Online}
\label{evSel:online}
The online selection consists mainly of the trigger system, 
described in technical detail in Section~\ref{exp:trigger}.  
%The implementation of the trigger's analysis-oriented f;adsjkl
%is discussed in the following sections, 
%especially the aspects relevant to this analysis.  
The implementation of the trigger system's algorithms 
that are relevant to this analysis 
is discussed in the following sections, 
including both the Level-1 and the High-Level Triggers.  
Both levels reconstruct possible physics objects 
%(in this analysis $e/\gamma$ or electron objects)
and apply criteria to select the interesting events.  
In general, the processing at the Level-1 is quicker 
and coarser in order to sort through a larger volume of data, 
while the High-Level Trigger processing can afford to be 
longer and more thorough because it only deals with 
data not already discarded by the Level-1.  
In addition, as a last step, the information 
from the High-Level Trigger is used to 
group the data into primary datasets
which are used as the basis for the offline selections.  

\subsection{Trigger Eras}
\label{evSel:triggerEras}
%\subsection{Electron Trigger}
%\subsubsection{Electron Algorithms}
%\subsubsection{Trigger Performance}
Since the LHC began taking data the event rate has changed by several orders of magnitude,  
%In order to keep up with the changing rate, 
and the trigger menus have evolved accordingly to deal with the changes.  
Initially, the collision rate was so low that minimum bias triggers ran unprescaled.  
However, it soon increased to the point where the minimum bias trigger rate became too high
and had to be prescaled, and photon triggers were used instead.  
Eventually the photon trigger rate at the desired threshold also became too high,
necessitating the extra constraints of the electron trigger at the same threshold.  
The rate for that trigger also increased, so to avoid prescaling the rate or increasing the threshold,
tighter selection criteria were applied to the objects that fired the trigger.  
These criteria are looser than those applied in the course of analysis and so are not expected
to seriously affect the trigger efficiency.

\subsection{Level-1 Trigger}
\label{evSel:L1}
%\subsubsection{Description of Algorithm}
%Description of egamma algorithm, along with diagrams.  
%The electron-reconstruction algorithm for the Level-1 trigger is implemented in the Regional Calorimeter Trigger (see detector section).
Reconstructing and triggering on an electron with the Level-1 Trigger 
involves information from the calorimeters, 
Regional Calorimeter Trigger, Global Calorimeter Trigger, and 
Global Trigger.  
Electrons and photons are indistinguishable in the L1 and are therefore 
treated the same, as ``$e/\gamma$'' objects.  

The ECAL trigger primitive generation system (TPG) combines the energy deposits 
from a 5x5 square of ECAL crystals into a single energy value corresponding to 
one trigger tower.% and sends it, 
%compressed, to the RCT.  
In addition, for each tower the ECAL TPG calculates a ``fine grain veto'' bit: 
if most of the tower's energy is deposited in a 2x5 strip of crystals, 
then the energy pattern is considered inconsistent with that of an electron
or photon, 
and the veto bit is set.  
% HOW EXACTLY IS SPIKE-KILLING DONE -- FG or zeroed?
Similarly, the HCAL also combines energy deposits into trigger towers; 
however, the HCAL fine grain structure bit is not used in electron-finding.  
The information from the ECAL and HCAL is compressed and sent to the 
Regional Calorimeter Trigger.  
The RCT does the main job of electron finding using several algorithms.  
The decompressed ECAL energy of each trigger tower is examined and 
compared to that of its four adjacent neighbors.  
If the energy of the tower is greater than that of its neighbors, 
it is considered an $e/\gamma$ candidate.  
The candidate energy is set to the energy of the tower in question 
plus that of its highest-energy neighbor.  
However, if the tower's fine grain bit is set, 
or if the ratio of the tower's HCAL energy to ECAL energy is too high, 
it is vetoed as a candidate.  
A candidate is additionally considered ``isolated'' if, 
out of the eight towers directly surrounding it, 
there are five contiguous towers forming an L-shape whose 
energies are low and who pass the fine grain and HCAL/ECAL ratio veto.  
Otherwise, the candidate is ``non-isolated''.  
The RCT sends the collections of isolated and non-isolated candidates to the 
Global Calorimeter Trigger, 
which sends the highest-energy ones to the final step, the Global Trigger.  
The Global Trigger then applies the criteria determining whether or not 
this event passes the current set of trigger paths,
for example, ``two $e/\gamma$ objects with energy above 10 GeV'' 
or ``one $e/\gamma$ object with energy above 17 GeV''.

\subsection{High-Level Trigger}
\label{evSel:HLT}

%\subsubsection{Description of Algorithms}
%Description of algorithms.

The algorithms used to reconstruct trigger objects 
in the High-Level Trigger are the same as those 
used in the offline analysis and are described in Chapter~\ref{evReco}.  
However, because of timing considerations, 
the algorithms are combined and configured differently at the HLT.  
The HLT has a limited amount of time in which to 
make a keep/discard decision for a given event 
in order to keep up with the flow of events.  
Therefore the algorithms are optimized for the best 
performance in the shortest time, 
which in practice means fewer steps and less 
complexity than the implementation at the offline level, 
where no such constraint exists.  
In particular, while offline-reconstructed electrons 
include tracker-driven electrons, 
those reconstructed at the HLT are ECAL-drive only, 
and the supercluster reconstruction algorithm uses 
a lower number of steps in the search process.  
Also, the size of the windows in which to search for 
hits in the pixel-matching part of the 
reconstruction is larger than that used offline.  

%% However, these algorithms are used in different ways at the HLT 
%% because of differences in performance considerations.  
%% Namely, the algorithms as implemented in the HLT tend to be 
%% configured to require 
%% fewer steps and less complexity than at the offline level.  
%% This includes in particular timing considerations.  
%% The HLT has a time constraint in which to make its decision 
%% to save or discard an event.  

%% Another theme: evolution of triggers, from photon to electron to calo eID to full eID/isol, 
%% for purpose of keeping rate down (manageable) as L goes up.

%% things common to all paths used: L1 match, SC reco, spike, et cut

%% somewhere say how even with additions of criteria, 
%% less complicated than offline still, and show why

The luminosity increase and consequent evolution of trigger menus 
described in Section~\ref{evSel:triggerEras} required incremental changes 
in the definitions of the current HLT paths.  
However, a few requirements remained common to all the paths used.  
In particular, the execution of each path begins by taking 
the Level-1 objects that passed the given L1 seed path 
and retrieving the information from the ECAL regions % make sure we're in context of MY HLT paths
around those objects.  
From this information, 
clusters of energy deposits are identified, 
and clusters having too narrow a spatial distribution are 
rejected as being spikes.  
%........???????
The trigger paths used in this analysis, shown in Table~\ref{TableTriggerPaths} 
all required (at least) one 
$e/\gamma$ or electron candidate above a certain energy threshold, 
with possible other criteria applied to the candidate as well.%, 
%depending on the path.  

Initially, the LHC collision rate was low enough that loose 
requirements and low thresholds could be used without 
overwhelming the system.  
The first trigger used did not require any matches to 
hits in the pixel part of the tracker, 
in contrast to all subsequent trigger paths used -- 
without tracking requirements, it was by definition a 
photon trigger.  
In addition, after a few menu iterations 
the energy threshold applied to the candidate 
increased from 15 GeV to 17 GeV.  
The size of the window used to search for potential pixel 
matches also decreased (from ``large-window'' to ``startup-window'').%, 
%and various further criteria were applied to 
Later, various further criteria were applied to 
the shape of the total energy deposit (\sieie, $H/E$) and 
to the quality of the match between the energy cluster and the track 
that make up the electron (\detain, \dphiin), 
as well as to the amount of energy surrounding 
the electron candidate (isolations).  
These further criteria are described in more detail in 
%Section~\ref{ELECSEL}; 
Sections~\ref{evSel:eid}~and~\ref{evSel:isol}; 
in the current section it is sufficient to say that they 
were added in steps to the trigger paths to gradually tighten the 
selection.

\subsection{Primary Datasets}
\label{evSel:PD}
The final step done centrally is the grouping of events passing similar 
HLT bits into primary datasets for storage.  
For example, in early running, all events passing a minimum-bias trigger 
were put into the MinimumBias dataset.  
Once the event rate increased and physics triggers fired more often, 
events were put into more specific datasets such as 
EG for all events passing $e/\gamma$ (electron or photon) triggers, 
or later, Electron for all events specifically passing 
electron triggers.  
These primary datasets are the groupings of stored data 
that the offline analyses begin with.  

\clearpage
\section{Offline}
\label{evSel:offline}
%Dataset (trig requirements), good vertex selection, etc
The offline selection consists of any criteria applied to the data 
after it has already been stored, 
i.e. criteria applied to an already-existing primary dataset.  
This analysis uses data from two consecutive primary datasets: 
the EG dataset gathered during earlier data-taking 
(Run2010A, from run 135821 to run 144114), 
and the Electron dataset from later data-taking 
(the Run2010B era, runs 146240 to 149711).  
In addition, it was required that the primary vertex of 
each event be ``good'': 
that is, within 24 cm of the nominal interaction point 
in the longitudinal direction
and 2 cm in the transverse direction, 
and having a minimum of 4 degrees of freedom,
which is a measure of the quality of the vertex fit.  %EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS MORE?
More detailed selections were made on the event contents, 
which will be discussed in the following sections.  
The electrons in these events were required to pass 
a series of criteria to determine ``good'' electrons.  
Finally, specific selections were made to the 
characteristics of the event as a whole 
in order to get the final collection of \Zee candidate 
events.  

\subsection{Electron Selection}
\label{evSel:elec}
The electron selection starts with the full set of objects reconstructed as electrons, 
i.e. ECAL energy deposits with nearby tracks.  
The objects in this collection are not necessarily real electrons 
%but energy deposits consistent with those from electrons at a low-level.  
but are consistent with the electron signature at a low level.  
%(talk about def of GSF electron etc so know what kinds of cuts have already been applied)   % to be done in eventReconstruction!
In order to select the reconstructed objects most likely to be real electrons from a Z, 
sets of further conditions are applied.  
%First electrons are matched to trigger objects passing an egamma trigger with a Level-1 threshold of 5 GeV.  
First the electrons are required to be within the $\eta$ region of ECAL in which 
they can be fully measured, in the barrel, $0. < |\eta| < 1.4442$, 
and in the endcap, $1.566 < |\eta| < 2.5$.  
A 25-GeV cut on the supercluster transverse energy is applied,
followed by a set of cuts designed to reject electrons from photon conversions.  
Another set of cuts aims to distinguish real electrons from other energy deposits which may mimic electrons, 
and finally a set of cuts to make sure the electron is isolated, i.e. not part of a jet unrelated to the Z.  

%All the different wp's for different purposes and efficiencies.  WP95 looser than trigger cuts by the end!  put other reasons too for wp80
The collaboration (or egamma group) created several different electron selections of varying tightness of cuts,
based on a given efficiency of the cuts (ref to iterative algo stuff).  
A tighter selection in general results in a purer sample of true electrons, but throws away many more
real electrons than a looser selection.  
These ``working points'' have target efficiencies ranging from 95\%-efficient at the loosest (WP95) to 60\% at the tightest (WP60).  
For early data-taking the WP95 and WP80 selections were chosen as the baseline selections for the Zee and Wenu analyses, respectively.
As more data accumulated, it became clear that WP80 provided better performance than WP95 for the Zee analysis, as well.  
A deciding factor in the switch was the fact that the evolving trigger paths eventually used selections that were
tighter than those used in the offline (WP95) analysis.  
This analysis uses the WP80 set of cuts for the complete dataset.  

\subsubsection{Conversion Rejection}
\label{evSel:convRej}
The conversion rejection step of the electron selection aims to eliminate photons that have converted into electron pairs.  
Several variables have been chosen to distinguish between conversions and prompt electrons, focusing on the track properties.  
Since prompt electrons are expected to hit the first layer of the tracker, 
any electron-associated track that is missing initial hits can be rejected as a conversion that occurred within the tracker.  
The looser requirements of the 95 percent efficient working point allow an electron to have one missing hit;
tighter working points such as WP80 require zero missing hits.  
Fig. \ref{fig:MissHitsConvRejVars} shows the number of missing hits for each electron.  
In addition, the conversion rejection algorithm searches for candidate electron-pair partner tracks, 
i.e. track pairs that appear to come from the same point.  
Every electron track is compared to all opposite-charge tracks within a dR cone of 0.3, and two values are calculated: 
a measure of the difference in the angles in the r-z plane between the two tracks (\dCotTheta, Fig. \ref{fig:DCotConvRejVars}), 
and the distance of closest approach between the two tracks in the x-y plane ($dist$, Fig. \ref{fig:DistConvRejVars}).  
Electron pairs from conversions are expected to have low values for both quantities, 
since both electron tracks begin at the point of conversion and initially have the same direction as the converting photon.  
The WP80 requirements apply a threshold at 0.02 for both quantities.  
%The 95-percent efficient working point is looser than the other working points in that it does not apply cuts on these quantities.  
%The other working points reject electrons having a value of less than 0.02 for both.  
%If an electron track corresponds to a track pair having values below that threshold for both variables, 
%it is assumed to be a conversion and is rejected.

\subsubsection{Electron Identification}
\label{evSel:eid}
Several ``electron identification'' variables are used to differentiate genuine electrons 
from other particles or conditions that may mimic electron behavior.  
Since an electron is reconstructed from a supercluster matched to a track, it is desired that the match is a good one.
The quality of matching can be estimated by looking at measures of the distance between the two components.
The position in $ \eta $ and $ \phi $ of the supercluster is compared with 
the $ \eta $ and $ \phi $ position of the track extrapolated back to the vertex, 
with the differences being labeled \detain and \dphiin, respectively.  
It is expected that a supercluster and track from the same electron will be close together, 
so upper limits on these quantities are defined as in Table \ref{TableEidCuts}.  
Distributions of electron \detain and \dphiin, plotted after the previous selection step (conversion rejection),
are shown in the figure-subfigure.  

An electron is also expected to deposit most of its energy in the electromagnetic portion of the calorimeter.  
A large hadronic energy deposit is more likely to come from a jet, 
so a limit on the ratio of the energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter 
to that in the hadronic calorimeter, $ H/E $, is applied (values given in the table).  
In addition, the electron's energy deposit is expected to be narrow relative to that of a jet.
A measure of the width in the $ \eta $ direction is therefore calculated 
using the energies and positions of the individual ECAL crystals, \sieie,
and this quantity is required to be below the thresholds listed in Table \ref{TableEidCuts}.  
(The $ \phi $ direction is not examined because bremsstrahlung from the electron 
can cause a significant spread of the energy in $ \phi $.)

\subsubsection{Electron Isolation}
\label{evSel:isol}
It is expected that the products of a Z decay will not come out in the vicinity of many other particles, 
since the Z decay products are not part of a jet.
We want to select those real electrons that are most likely to be prompt decay products,
not those that come from some interaction with lots of other end products.  
Therefore we apply a set of cuts requiring little detector activity in the area immediately surrounding the reconstructed electron.  
The so-called isolation cuts look at the energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters separately,
as well as the total \pt of neighboring tracks, within specified \DR cones around the electron-associated deposit/track.  
These energies are divided by the \pt of the electron itself to arrive at a relative value,
which allows for higher-energy particles that may deposit more energy in the surrounding area.  
The thresholds for each of the three types of isolation is set separately for barrel and endcap, 
as given in Table \ref{TableEisoCuts}.  

%Conditions to require that electrons found are isolated, i.e. not contained in a jet with other particles.  
%We want (``prompt''?) electrons that come directly from the Z, 
%not from some other interaction with lots of other end products packaged along with the electron.

\subsubsection{Matching Offline-Reconstructed Objects to Trigger Objects}
\label{evSel:matching}
In order to ensure that the offline-reconstructed objects being examined were also reconstructed by the trigger, 
each offline object is compared with the list of trigger objects firing a given path.  
If the offline object lies close enough to a trigger object (measured by \DR), 
it is considered to have passed the trigger.  
%All electrons used in this analysis are required to be trigger-matched in this way.  
Each event in this analysis was required to have at least one electron trigger-matched in this way, 
within a \DR distance of 0.2.  
This demonstrates that the constituent objects on the event did in fact fire an appropriate trigger.  
%According to distribution of \DR between offline and trigger objects shown in Fig. \ref{fig:TriggerObjectSelectionDeltaR}, 
%the threshold was chosen to be NUMBER.

\subsubsection{Efficiency of Selection for \Zee Events}
\label{evSel:eff}
Tag and Probe:  The tag and probe method is used to determine the efficiency of a given set of electron selection steps.  
In this method, a set of data events is identified which appear to be good 
%Z->ee 
\Zee
candidate events.  
One of the electrons in each of these events must pass 
all selection cuts and essentially be identified as a golden electron; 
%some stringent
this is the tag.  
%The other electron must 
%pass some less stringent criteria
%be identified at least as a supercluster; 
The criteria applied to the other electron are looser: it is not required to pass the selection cuts being tested.  
This is the probe electron.  
The event's status as a Z candidate is determined by enforcing a mass window cut on the invariant mass of the tag-probe system 
(this is sufficient(enough?) to select a high-purity sample of events in which both legs are real electrons -- REFERENCE??).  
The naive selection efficiency is then given by the fraction of probe electrons that pass the requirement being tested.  

However, a more sophisticated analysis of the efficiency can be performed by fitting the invariant mass spectra of the
tag-probe pairs for both passing and failing probes to a lineshape representing both the signal and the background.  
Then the distribution of passing probes can be represented as the signal lineshape multiplied by the efficiency and the
total number of signal events added to the background lineshape multiplied by the number of passing background events.  
The failing probe distribution can be represented in the analogous way, using (1-efficiency) instead.  
From this pair of fits the total number of events as well as the efficiency can be extracted simultaneously.
