\subsection{Z Production}
\subsection{Z Decay}

somewhere have intro to QFT and all that?  

also, explanatory items from overview:

   * [here or] in theory chapter define ``tree-level''.  
ALSO IN THEORY: explain how Feynman diagrams are so useful! 
writing down the matrix element and all that
AND PDFs, basically whole process of stuff simulated 
really happens and should be explained.  
AND DEF OF PARTONS
yeah, basically explain all the stuff in the MC chapter
INCLUDING ISR and FSR
ALSO define ``jets'' and talk about how they come from 
quarks and gluons (define partons) and relate to ``hadronization'' -- 
not entirely relevant for this analysis, 
but possible in general
AND define ``color''
AND asymptotic freedom, how it takes more and more energy to get them further apart

   * intial- and final-state radiation

   * HERE OR IN THEORY INTRO need to do on-shell/off-shell decays 
to explain why Z mass has a spectrum and not a single value

   * invariant mass (here?)

AND, of course read the others' theses to see what they had in here, too.
