\section{Measurement of Cross Section}
\label{over:xsec}
%xsec(Z) = n(Zee) / ( L * BR(Zee) * eff )
\[
\sigma_{ Z } \times \textrm{ BR }_{ Zee } = \frac{ n_{ Zee } }{  \mathcal{ L } \times \epsilon \times A}
\]
where
\[
%\epsilon = \epsilon_{ acc } \times \epsilon_{ trig } \times \epsilon_{ reco } \times \epsilon_{ sel }
\epsilon = \epsilon_{ trig } \times \epsilon_{ reco } \times \epsilon_{ sel }
\]

   * particles?  although that's theory intro (but need SOME particle-specific stuff) 

%the practical purpose of MC -- can simulate all stages of gen/sim/reco/etc and compare 
%everything step-by-step with data, as well as of course getting some quantities 
%that require extra knowledge, like acceptance (and predicting efficiencies, rates, etc)
%HA, that sounds like a few of those things in the pythia manual intro!  and I came 
%up with them myself!  

%glossary? (explanatory text, with true glossary in appendix?)  

   * acceptance, efficiency (especially for that formula above)

   * cross section!

   * signal, background

   * ``data-driven'' stuff?  need for efficiency, but also systs??


\section{Anatomy of Event}

Like, what actually happens!

   * underlying event!

   * pileup.  maybe under, like, ``the anatomy of an event'' or ``the structure of an event?''

\section{Terms in particle physics, technical stuff}

   * ``event''!  

   * ``high-energy''

   * ``kinematic'' maybe previous section?

   * ``hard'' vs ``soft''

   * histogram?  errors? (stat/syst) etc?

   * statistical and systematic uncertainties or errors

   * ``phase space''!

\section{coordinates used?}

   * eta, phi, transverse quantities

\section{General aANlsysis programs}

   * ROOOOOOOOOT!  other software, like CMSSW? yes
