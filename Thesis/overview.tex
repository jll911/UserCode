\section{Measurement of Cross Section}
\label{over:xsec}

   * particles?  although that's theory intro (but need SOME particle-specific stuff) 

%the practical purpose of MC -- can simulate all stages of gen/sim/reco/etc and compare 
%everything step-by-step with data, as well as of course getting some quantities 
%that require extra knowledge, like acceptance (and predicting efficiencies, rates, etc)
%HA, that sounds like a few of those things in the pythia manual intro!  and I came 
%up with them myself!  

%glossary? (explanatory text, with true glossary in appendix?)  

Introductory terminology?  put terminology section in beginning?

want to talk about Z and why important, motivations

   * events
In particle physics, an ``event'' is a particle interaction 
that has been captured and recorded by the detector.  
%   * signal, background.  
In general, %events that contribute to the specific process     
events caused by the specific process     
being studied are termed ``signal,'' 
while any events 
%that do not contribute 
from other sources 
are called ``background.'' 
A significant part of any analysis is designing 
criteria that select signal events while 
rejecting background events, 
so that the analysis focuses only on data containing 
that process.  
The number of events for a given signal can be used 
to calculate quantities of interest, 
for example how often that process  
occurs relative to others.  

   * cross section!
The cross section, the quantity being calculated in this analysis, 
is such a measure of ``how often things happen.''  
However, it's not measured as a rate (occurrences per unit time), 
it's measured as a cross-sectional area 
and represents the probability of the given interaction occurring.  
An analogy may be made to trying to hit a target with a tennis ball.  
The bigger the target is, the more likely you will be able to hit it.  
The sizes of both objects matter: 
a trajectory that would cause a tennis ball to just miss the target 
would cause a basketball to clip the edge, 
solely because of the basketball's larger size.  
Therefore ``cross section'' may be more precisely defined as the 
effective cross-sectional area of the target, 
taking into account the sizes of both the target and the projectile.  
When both the target and projectile are particles, %such as protons, 
they may interact ``at a distance,'' that is, without ``touching'' each other, 
through the fundamental forces.  
(For example, electrons are thought to be point particles 
and therefore have no spatial extent, 
but they still attract and repel other particles 
through the electromagnetic force.) 
This interaction-at-a-distance increases the effective cross section.  
An interaction involving two particles that 
interact with each other very strongly has a large cross section.  
The cross section depends on the strength of the force between them.  
FORMULA AND EXPLANATION HERE??

According to the definition, ``interaction cross section'' applies only to 
the particles doing the colliding.  
However, a cross section is usually associated with the entire process, 
such as (in our case) 
$ q\bar{q} \rightarrow Z/ \gamma^{*} \rightarrow e^{+} e^{-} $.  
Here, the number calculated as the cross section takes into account 
only those events where a \Zg is formed, 
as well as the fact that only some of those events decay into electrons.  
The fraction of events that decay to a certain final state is known as 
the branching ratio, abbreviated BR.  
When it is not explicitly mentioned along with the cross section 
for a given final state, it is understood to be included.  
Adding up the cross sections for all of these possible interactions 
would give the full proton-proton interaction cross section.  

%xsec(Z) = n(Zee) / ( L * BR(Zee) * eff )
\[
\sigma_{ Z } \times \textrm{ BR }_{ Zee } = \frac{ n_{ Zee } }{  \mathcal{ L } \times \epsilon \times A}
\]
where
\[
%\epsilon = \epsilon_{ acc } \times \epsilon_{ trig } \times \epsilon_{ reco } \times \epsilon_{ sel }
\epsilon = \epsilon_{ trig } \times \epsilon_{ reco } \times \epsilon_{ sel }
\]

   * acceptance, efficiency (especially for that formula above)


   * ``data-driven'' stuff?  need for efficiency, but also systs??


\section{Anatomy of Event}

Like, what actually happens!

   * underlying event!

   * pileup.  maybe under, like, ``the anatomy of an event'' or ``the structure of an event?''

\section{Terms in particle physics, technical stuff}

%   * ``event''!  

   * ``high-energy''
``High-energy'' physics refers to modern particle physics. 
In the beginnings of particle physics, 
the available accelerators operated at much lower energies.  
Low-energy accelerators are still used in nuclear physics 
and aid in materials physics and biophysics studies. 
However, to probe the fundamental interactions between particles, 
today's accelerators use much higher energies.  

   * ``kinematic'' maybe previous section?
In the following pages, much will be described by the word 
``kinematic'' or ``kinematics''.  
This refers to the properties of position or motion.  
So, ``kinematic criteria'' means selections applied according to 
quantities such as momentum or angle.  

   * ``hard'' vs ``soft''


   * histogram?  errors? (stat/syst) etc?

   * statistical and systematic uncertainties or errors

   * ``phase space''!

\section{coordinates used?}

   * center of momentum reference frame
For some high-energy physics experiments, 
there is a choice of several reference 
frames that can be used for measurement, 
each with their own benefits.  
%
However, in the case of proton-proton collisions, 
the logical reference frame for measurements is 
the frame at rest with respect to the detector, 
the ``lab frame,'' 
because it is the same as the 
proton-proton center of momentum frame.  
Therefore all measurements are done 
in the lab frame.  

   * eta, phi, transverse quantities -- relate eta to y and all that, 
talk about difference, talk about meaning of each one

A particular set of coordinates is often used to describe 
the direction of outgoing or intermediate particles.  
The direction of the incoming particles defines an axis, 
the beam axis.  
The azimuthal angle, measured around this axis 
and analogous to longitude on the earth's surface, 
is labeled $\phi$.  
The angle along the axis, the polar angle 
(analogous to latitude), 
is labeled by $\theta$.  
However, it is much more common to measure this 
angle in terms of pseudorapidity, $\eta$, 
which is given as a function of $\theta$:
\[
\eta = -\ln \left[ \tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right]
\]
$\eta$ is preferred because of its relation to another quantity, 
rapidity, $y$, which is a function of the particle's 
energy and momentum:
\[
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{E+p_L}{E-p_L} \right)
\]
where $p_L$ is the longitudinal component of the 
particle's momentum (the component parallel to the beam axis).  
% WON'T DO COMPOSITION OF VECTORS
Rapidity is useful when dealing with relativistic speeds, 
such as those at which the particles typically travel.  
When viewed from separate reference frames that are moving 
at relativistic speeds with respect to each other, 
a particle's speed, direction, and energy appear to be different.  
However, rapidity has special status in that the 
difference in rapidity 
between two particles does not change 
when the reference frame is changed.  
A particle's rapidity can be approximated by the 
pseudorapidity if it is very light or 
traveling very fast 
(pseudorapidity is identical to rapidity 
if the particle has zero mass, 
in which case it is also 
moving at the speed of light).  
In addition, outgoing particles tend to be 
distributed uniformly in terms of rapidity, 
as opposed to the polar angle $\theta$, 
which does not enjoy the same uniform distribution. 
Since rapidity itself is not a measure of angle, 
pseudorapidity is used as the coordinate.  
Rapidity is calculated in cases 
where the particle of interest may be heavy 
and may not have a high speed, 
for example the Z boson examined in this analysis.
